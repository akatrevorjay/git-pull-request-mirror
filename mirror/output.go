// The purpose of this method is to account for the semantic differences between the comments on a GitHub
// pull request and the comments on a git-appraise review.
//
// More specifically, GitHub issue comments roughly correspond to git-appraise review-level comments, and
// GitHub pull request comments roughly correspond to git-appraise line-level comments, but with the
// following differences:
//
// 1. None of the GitHub comments can have a parent, but any of the git-appraise ones can.
// 2. The author and timestamp of a GitHub comment is based on the call to the API, so if we want to
//    mirror a comment from git-appraise into GitHub, then when we read that new comment back out this
//    metadata will be different.
// 3. Review-level comments in git-appraise can have a specificed commit, but issue comments can not.
// 4. File-level comments in git-appraise have no corresponding equivalent in GitHub.
// 5. Line-level comments in GitHub have to be anchored in part of the diff, while in git-appraise
//    they can occur anywhere within the file.
//
// To work around these issues, we build in the following leeway:
// 1. We treat two comment descriptions as equivalent if one looks like a quote of the other.
// 2. We treat two locations as equivalent if one of the following holds:
//    0. They actually are the same
//    1. Both are review-level comments, and one of them does not have a commit set
//    2. They are either file-level or line-level comments and occur in the same file
//
// This definition of equivalence does allow some information to be lost when converting from one
// format to the other, but the important information (who said what) gets maintained and we avoid
// accidentally mirroring the same comment back and forth multiple times.
